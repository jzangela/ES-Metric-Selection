# ES-Metric-Selection
This is a repository for the ES metric selection project. In this project, I adapt the lineup protocol approach to inform the selection of effect size metrics for continuous outcomes by visualizing parameter relationships in meta-analysis under varying distributional assumptions for nuisance parameters. To compare patterns between empirical and simulated data, I first conducted meta-analyses of empirical parameter estimates, which later informed the simulation design. I then carried out simulation studies based on these empirical parameters, assuming the true effect was expressed using either the standardized mean difference (SMD) or the log response ratio (LRR) metric.

This repository contains a complete reference list for the current study.

Here’s a brief survey—I’m curious to learn more about the discipline you're working in and any challenges you’ve encountered when selecting effect size metrics. I'd welcome any further questions, comments, or suggestions: https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bg80GczhhOUuXeC

Thank you for your interest!
