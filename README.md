# ES-Metric-Selection
This is a repository for the ES metric selection project. In this project, I adapt the lineup protocol approach to guide the selection of effect size metrics for continuous outcomes by visualizing parameter relationships in meta-analysis under varying distributional assumptions for nuisance parameters. To compare patterns between empirical and simulated data, I first conducted meta-analyses of empirical parameter estimates, which informed the simulation design. I then carried out simulation studies based on these empirical parameters, assuming the true effect was expressed using either the standardized mean difference (SMD) or the log response ratio (LRR) metric.

This repository contains a complete reference list for the current study.
